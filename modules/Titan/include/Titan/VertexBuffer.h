	//this class is a lot shorter than the index buffer as the exact type of data the vertices are stored in isn't that important 
	// so we can just use the LoadData from IBuffer and the overloads to ensure the types were compabatile with the index buffer 
	//took a lot of code, in reality, niether class is missing any required functionality
